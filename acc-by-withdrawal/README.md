### Smooth-scripts

This script generates in the `/results` folder a JSON file `accumulated_rewards_eth.json` with the accumulated rewards of each withdrawal address in Smooth. This JSON file can be used in [Snapshot](https://snapshot.box/) to define the voting strategy of the Smooth DAO (and therefore, the voting power of each Smooth user).

The JSON file can be tested in Snapshot's [playground](https://v1.snapshot.box/#/playground/whitelist-weighted), where an aditional `.txt` file is needed to test. This file is also generated by the script and also stored in the `/results` folder.

> ℹ️ **Important:** The voting strategy of the SmoothDAO should be defined _before_ the proposal is created in Snapshot. This is because the voting power of each user is calculated at the time of the proposal creation. If the voting strategy is changed after the proposal is created, the voting power of each user will not be updated.


The accumulated_rewards_eth.json should look like this:

```json
{
  "symbol": "ETH",
  "addresses": {
    "0x9c1ae32c81993146eb0cb0030f1277a931902419": "51.289381467563397912",
    "0xcfe058a75895e6c036cee21a401ecd346b12ea23": "39.026386408899496641",
    "0x67C1A3e1Ce35c31Cd4fC27F987821b48cA928d57": "28.606610718434077769",
    ...
  }
}
```
