### Relay Response Testing

This script sends a significant number of requests to the main ethereum relays. It computes unique responses and how many times each response was received. Results are saved in a new `relay-results-api-2000.txt` file. Number of requests to each relay can be adjusted in the script.

#### Usage

```bash
python3 relay-rate-limit.py
```
